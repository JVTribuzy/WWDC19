 To help us play bass on our band pratice you need to...play a **bass** ...😂😂😂,
 **But let's start explaining the some fundamentals!!**
 
 On music, we have something called **melody**, wich is a combination of musical notes, building a litle **musical idea**. Each **melody** has a single peculiarity, established by the music in which it is inserted.
 ### See and listen the melody...
 - Experiment:
    To learn how to play bass...
 
    1.  Select what melody you want...(For this, we'll use a variable called **'melody'**. Change the variable value to change what melody will play.)
    2.  Tap on **Run my Code**.
    3.  Tap play to listen and "see" the melody.
    4.  Try to reproduce it...

/*:
 - Note:
    When you tap the **Play Button**▶️, wait to listen the melody. You can listen the melody whenever you want.
    I'm will help you with some visual effects...but don't get used to it...😏😏
    When you want to change the melody, remember to tap on **Run my Code** again.
 ### I challenge you reproduce this on the bass!😎
 
 ...
 
 After this, you can go to the [next page](@next)...😎😎
