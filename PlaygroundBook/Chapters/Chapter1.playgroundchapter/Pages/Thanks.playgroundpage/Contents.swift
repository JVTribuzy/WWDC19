 # Congratulations!!
 
 Now you are a bass player...ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž even if just on this **Swift Playground**ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜‚
 But... let me tell you a story... this playground is how about I started to play bass.
 
 One day some friends of mine invited me to play a bass in their band practice, but at that time, I had never played bass in my life...ðŸ˜¬
 But I went, even though I was cluelessâ€¦
 
 They showed me what notes I needed to play. After I memorized the notes, then I memorized the note's sequence of the music...
 That way, I learned three musics in one day...ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 
 After that day, I decided to study bass for the rest of my life... and today, music is my passion.
 On that day, with my friends, I had a motivation: Try something I knew nothing about
 
 ...
 
 To make this playground, I had a motivation too, but now, it is...*/
let motivation = "WWDC19"

 If you want to do or learn something new, just go for it. If you don't try, the answers will always be negative, so look for the positive ones.ðŸ˜‰
