 # Congratulations!!
 
 Now you are a bass player...ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž even if just on this PlaygroundðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜‚
 But... let me tell you a story... this playground is how about I start play bass.
 
 One day some friends invite me to play a bass in his band practice, but at this moment, I never tried to play a bass on my life...ðŸ˜¬
 But I went, even know nothing about this...
 
 They show me what notes a needed to play. After I memorize the notes, I memorize the sequence of notes of the music...
 On this way I learn three musics on this day...ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 
 After this day, I decide to study bass for the rest of my life... Today, music is my passion.
 on That day, with my friends, I had a motivation: Try something I know nothing
 
 ...
 
 To make this playground, I had a motivation too, but now, the motivation is different.*/
let motivation = "WWDC19"
