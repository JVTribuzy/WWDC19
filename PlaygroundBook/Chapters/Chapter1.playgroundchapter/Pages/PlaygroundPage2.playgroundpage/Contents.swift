 Ok, now you know a litle more about the **Music World**,so  let's make something more dificult...
 **I challenge you** to make something similar, but with some diferences.
 The process is the same...
 
 - Experiment:
 
     1. Select what melody you want...(For this, change the **'melody'**.
     2. Tap on **Run my Code**.
     3. Tap play to listen the melody.
     4. Try to reproduce it...
 
 ---
 
 - Note:
    Now, we have some diference, you'll don't have any visual responce. Just listen and try to reproduce...yes, you can, you are a bass player yet...ðŸ˜Ž
