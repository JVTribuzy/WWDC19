 Ok, now you know a little more about the **Music World**, so let's make something more difficult...
 **I challenge you** to make something similar, but with some diferences.
 The process is the same...
 
 - Experiment:
 
     1. Select what melody you want...(For this, change the **'melody'** value).
     2. Tap **Run my Code**.
     3. Tap play to listen the melody.
     4. Try to reproduce it...
 
 ---
 
 - Note:
    Now, we have some difference, you won't have any visual response. Just listen and try to reproduce...yes, you can, you already are a bass player...ðŸ˜Ž But remember, you can play just after you listen... calm down, let's do this step by step...
